**Foster Care in the US** 
In the US 2019, 423,997 children were in the foster system with 251,359 newly entered children and 248,669 exiting. The average age of a child in foster care is 8.4 years old and males are the majority by 4%. For the Transitional Aged Youth (18-24), they only make up about 4% of the total foster care youth in the US. 44% of foster care youth are white and 23% were black. Similar to foster care statistics in Virginia alone, the average time in care is 19.6 months. According to *The AFCARS Report* in 2019, only 3,335 (1%) children who entered the foster care system were 18+ and it was most likely due to neglect. However, there were 20,465 (8%) youths 18+ who exited the system most likely due to aging out and emancipation. 


**Foster Care in Virginia** 
Based on the 2020 Foster Care Reports from *The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System*, there were 5,530 children in foster care in Virginia with the majority of them being ages 1-5 years old (23.5%) and second most children being ages 16-18 (20.7%). The average time they were in care was 18.85 months whether that was they were adopted, returned home, started living in Independent living, placed with relatives or aged out. 


**Foster Care Transitional Aged Youth in Virginia** 
Based on the table from *Supporting Young People Transitioning from Foster Care: Virginia Findings from National Survey and Policy Scan* by Child Trends for the
Better Housing Coalition and Childrenâ€™s Home Society of Virginia, Elizabeth Jordan, JD, Garet Fryar, BA, Kerry DeVooght, MSW, 58% foster care kids graduate high school by 19 compared to the general population of 87%. <3% graduate college by 25 compared to 28%. 46% are employed by 26 compared to 80%. 51% are eligible for employer-provided health insurance compared to 71%. Only 9% have their own residence by age 26 compared to 30% of the general population in Virginia. For youth involved in foster care, 42% females and 68% males will be arrested by age 26 whereas only 5% females and 22% males of the general population. Virginia has 14%-22% of its foster care youth between ages 16-20 which according to Child Trends is the transition age. 


**Foster Care Transitional Aged Youth in Loudoun County** 
According to the *The Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System*, in 2020 there were 48 children in foster care in only Loudoun County which was .8% in the state of Virginia. As you can see in the pie chart above, over 2/3 of those children were boys and 1/3 were girls and the minority of them of ethnicity of Hispanic. Almost 50% of those children were white, 25% black and less than 5% Asian and multi-racial. When we are looking at only transitional aged youth from 18-24 where 21 years old is the average time a foster child ages out, there were only 8 children. In Loudoun County, it does not seem like there are many foster care youths who are aging out of the system but only 9 other counties have greater than 9 foster care kids over the age of 18.
